#_What I aim to solve_#

Presentations on the internet are a very finicky buisness. Sites like Prezi and Slideshare have their pros and cons, but I wanted something very simple

The inspiration came from my watching of DEFCON talks, when the presenters were on stage presenting, they often had a presentation showing their expolits behind them, mostly using Microsoft Powerpoint. They _All_ had individual styles, some easy to read, some hard, some conscise and some long, and most with a video element in them.
